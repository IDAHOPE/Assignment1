By listing the first six prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13, we can see that the 6th
prime is 13.
What is the 10,001st prime number?

#include <stdio.h>
int main ()
{
  int term=10001, count = 0, num = 2, result = 0;
  while (count != term)
    {
      int flag = 0;
      for (int i = 2; i <= num/2; i++)
        {
            if (num % i == 0)
                {
                    flag++;
                    break;
                }
        }
        if (flag == 0)
        {
            count++;
            result = num;
        }
        num = num + 1;
    }
  printf ("%dth prime number is %d ",term,result);
  return 0;
}
